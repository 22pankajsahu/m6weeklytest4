## How it Works
This web application allows users to search for the availability of hotels. It uses the [Hotels.com API](https://hotelslists.free.beeceptor.com/gethotels) to fetch hotel data. Users can select a destination, enter dates, and specify the number of travelers to search for available hotels. The application then displays a list of hotels with details.

The provided code is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an overview of the languages and their functionalities used in the code:

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**:
   - HTML is used for structuring the web page content.
   - It defines the structure of the web page, including elements like headings, paragraphs, links, forms, and images.
   - In this code, HTML is used to create the overall structure of the webpage, define the navigation bar, input fields, buttons, and the main content area.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**:
   - CSS is used for styling the web page and controlling its layout.
   - It defines the presentation and appearance of HTML elements.
   - In this code, CSS is used to style various elements, such as the navigation bar, search input fields, buttons, and the results section. It sets properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and backgrounds to create a visually appealing design.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - JavaScript is a scripting language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
   - It enables the manipulation of HTML elements, handling user interactions, and making asynchronous requests to APIs.
   - In this code, JavaScript is used for the following functionalities:
     - Fetching hotel data from an API (Hotels.com) using the `fetch` API.
     - Displaying the fetched hotel data on the web page dynamically by creating HTML elements and appending them to the DOM.
     - Filtering hotels based on user input (destination) and updating the displayed results accordingly.
     - Handling user interactions such as button clicks.

These languages work together to create a web application that allows users to search for hotel availability and view the results in a visually pleasing and interactive manner. HTML defines the structure, CSS defines the styling, and JavaScript adds functionality to the webpage.
